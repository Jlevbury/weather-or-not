# weather forecast application
https://jlevbury.github.io/weather-or-not/ 

## Description
This weeks challenge was create from scratch, an application that allows a user to enter a city name, retrieve the current weather conditions and a five day forecast. Additionally, when a new city is searched, the previous city is stored into the users local storage. Upon clicking the cities name in the previously searched section, the current and five day forecast fields will populate with the updated information reflecting any date changes. The information displayed contains the current temperature, humidity, windspeed and an icon infographic of the weather conditions.


## Learning Experience
During the process of completing this project, I identified several weak points in my JavaScript working knowledge and intend to reinforce those weaknesses moving forward based off of my experience with this weeks challenge. Creating a local storage item, then creating a callback function that worked off of that item was uncharted territory for myself and took a bit of sleuthwork to make sure as I added code each part continued to communicate with both the API and other functions in the script correctly. 
I utilized assistance from both my classmates and askBCS for this project , while I was able to navigate a majority of the blockages myself, when it came to some debugging of var references I needed an extra set of eyes. Additionally the extra eyes helped to point out some areas of improvement with my code logic which is another focus point for future studies. 

Some minor practice in function testing was also used during the process of developing this app based on past input from graders and interactions with askBCS.I did implement much more console logging of items as I wrote them to help prevent errors down the road, there is a clear equivalent I noticed in my code error likelyhood when I did not adhere to this my difficulties in debugging rose. So I will continue to console log and proof test my functions as they are developed after seeing the payoff in doing such.
